      Improving the implementation of bicycles in the <a href="https://tmg.utoronto.ca/doc/1.4/gtamodel/index.html" target="_blank">GTAModel</a> (written proposal, 2024)
    </h3>
    <p>
      The GTAModel is a regional transportation model used by the City of Toronto and Metrolinx. The model tests outcomes of transport policies (e.g., the One Fare Program). I heard about it through a past mentor, who did his master's with the professor that manages it. I decided to pursue the opportunity when I realized that this professor worked on a map I had seen in high school, which showed the distances cyclists could travel through downtown Toronto at various levels of bravery (i.e., the degree to which a cyclist is willing to travel along roads in high traffic). I was interested in implementing similar data into the GTAModel and the professor said that could be possible.

        More specifically, we decided my task would be to 1) implement Toronto's BikeShare system into the model, 2) improve the accuracy of the bike network in the model, and 3) improve the route assignment step of the model for bike trips (i.e., choosing which routes a cyclist is most likely to take). I began by reading textbooks about transportation modelling, then conducted a literature review of bicycle modelling, along with preliminary data analysis to understand the existing bike usage data. This data was obtained from Torontoâ€™s OpenData portal (Toronto's BikeShare stations and user trips) and aggregated with Python (using the Pandas library).

      While writing the program, I had to learn memory management. Since the OpenData datasets had more than 100,000 data points, I needed to apply software architecture and functional programming principles; for example, it is best to avoid storing data in the code and only modifying it, in order to conduct analysis. The outcome was a better understanding of trends in peak hour usage (top), and trips origins and destinations (bottom). 
      I also tried to identify gaps in the model's existing bike network. To do so, I spatially aggregated the GTAModel's existing bicycle network and traffic analysis zones, a 2024 network created by another research group, and additional OpenData pedestrian and bike networks using ArcGIS. During this process, I documented the model's existing bike routes (for the research group), as well as propose new "links" (i.e., bike routes) to represent bike lanes that were not already captured in the model.

  <div class="row">
    <div class="column">
      <p>
        Next, I suggested a way to improve the route prediction of bike trips, I created an algorithm using the API of third-party software used by the GTAModel called Emme to predict route choices. The algorithm classified bike routes based on road and safety conditions, and required an in-depth understanding of so-called "traffic stress" that cyclists experience, and of the model. To identify relevant edge cases and boundary conditions, I read the model's and Emme's documentation, learned to use Emme, and reviewed literature on bike networks.

    I used VSCode and GitHub for feedback and collaboration with my supervisor, including learning clean code & clean architecture principles, functional programming, and effective use of memory when analysing large datasets. I also used GeoPandas and gained a better understanding of ArcGIS. Most importantly, I learned to work mostly independently and within an ambiguous framework: I originally had a list of requests from my supervisor that I had to figure out and turn into manageable, actionable tasks. In fact, the research I did was largely based on a work plan the professor created for me, but which I intentionally cut down to align with my current skill level. I realized that while pursuing every research route was technically possible, given enough time, I needed to choose a few routes that were practical and useful for me to pursue.

  <p>In my third-year steel design course, I worked with a group to design a steel hangar and office building. Although the course project usually involves SAP2000, which does a majority of the necessary calculations automatically, we were challenged to create the spreadsheets and make decisions regarding engineering assumptions using the Handbook of Steel Construction (HSC). 
    To approach the project, we divided the tasks: some group members created the preliminary spreadsheet to organize the calculations, and I, along with some other members, worked on the structural analysis calculations. For simplicity, these were done by hand (see images) and then implemented within the spreadsheet.

      This project was largely iterative. For example, when designing the steel members used for the columns, we had to account for the loads of the beams the columns were carrying, along with the "self-weight" of the columns. In essence, we could not design the columns until we knew the total loading they had to bear, which depended on the particular column design we chose. Thus, along the course of the project, we slowly developed an intuition for designing the various structural member, developing strategies to estimate the total load a member might have to bear, then iteratively determining exactly which design is the most efficient.

        Because of this, the group collaborated to develop the spreadsheet to optimize our design process. For example, I created a section of our spreadsheet that would automatically calculate the load resistance of a column without needing to manually which column design was used. Previously, we were using a version of the spreadsheet that required the user to input a particular column design before the resistance was calculated. After my update, we could test every single one of our current column designs at once without manually testing them one-by-one. 
  Similarly, I applied my understanding of the nuanced and highly complex structural analysis of "beam-column" members, a particularly complicated type of structural member, and created a spreadsheet that would calculate their loading resistance. Once again, I focused on automating this process to minimize user-related input errors.
  This project also required attention to detail and a close reading and detailed understanding of the HSC. All decisions made over the course of the project needed to be well-justified by the Steel Code, so we all developed a nuanced understanding of the pertinent clauses governing the design of the various structural members. We also ensured these clauses were reflected in the AutoCAD drawings we did.

        Along with integrating the detailed structural analysis calculations into the spreadsheet, our team also developed an understanding of optimizing Excel for the purpose of automation and error-minimization. For example, we learned to link spreadsheets together to improve organization. We also implemented certain principles of software architecture like the use of design patterns (i.e., replicating the same spreadsheet structure across multiple different spreadsheets) to minimize user errors and improve ease of functionality. Similarly, in line with software architecture principles, we tried to minimize "dependencies" across the spreadsheetsâ€”I took care to investigate which spreadsheet cells should have fixed values, and which can be changed, and enforced a strict hierarchy throughout all spreadsheets so the base layer of data could not be altered by a user when doing a design check. This proved very helpful in improving our workflow and efficiency. Before, we had to manually reset certain parameters when doing a particular design check, but I used conditional code to encapsulate those steps within each spreadsheet. I implemented visual cues to also improve user interaction with the spreadsheet.

          How Frequent is Frequent Enough? Exploring the Relationship between the Approach to Identify Ride- sourcing Users and the Specification of Adoption Models

  After a UofT PhD grad came to speak in one of my first-year lectures about his financial analysis work with Uber, I became interested in the area of transportation modelling. I contacted the supervising professor and learned a current PhD student was working on a project an undergrad could lead. This led me to collaborate with two PhD students in UofT's Travel Demand Group to write a paper investigating models that predict ride-sourcing (e.g., Uber) demand. Although the project involved large datasets from surveys conducted in Toronto and Vancouver, the research question was relatively simple, asking how the way a Uber "user" is defined in a model can affect the model's result; in other words, what number of weekly or monthly trips should be used in household surveys to categorize respondents as ride-sourcing "users" or "non-users." 
</p>
</div>

<div class="row2">
    <p>
      I conducted background research into current ride-sourcing models and reviewed existing literature on approaches to models. Through this research, I was able to compile a general framework to apply to the datasets provided by the Cities of Toronto and Vancouver. The general result of the model is summarized as a diagram.
      To align with the current literature and industry modelling practices, we created and studied logistic regression models. However, since I had not previously modeled, I began by conducting research to understand the underlying assumptions, limitations, and theory of logistic regression models. I read textbooks, conducting additional research, and read code and documentation to understand the data analysis packages in R. Then, I made multiple logistic regression models using R. Each model was created using a different definition of a "ride-sourcing user" in order to better understand the impacts of customer behaviour and loyalty over the short- and long-term.

  </div>

<div class="row2">
<p>
  Once the models were finished, I wrote the literature review, results and discussion sections of the final paper. I also evaluated the models based on research-backed metrics like ROC and R2 that estimate model accuracy. All methods suggested a relatively good fit. I learned to effectively take feedback from my supervisor and to appropriately draw conclusions from the models, i.e., creating nuanced interpretations that consider limitations. 
  The paper was accepted for presentation at the Transportation Research Board 2024 Conference in Washington DC (see picture above). At this conference, I got the chance to present my research to researchers and policymakers from across Canada and the US. I also attended talks about the implementation of driverless cars in San Francisco, traffic management, and best practices for planning infrastructure to accommodate micro-mobility. I learned about the political, behavioral, and practical barriers to transportation ideas, the ways people are tackling them, and how my work could fit into that.

    Course project to design a water distribution and sewer system for a proposed development.
  </h3>

  <div class="row2">
    <p>
    Over the course of two months in my Municipal Engineering class, my team worked to design a water distribution network and a sewer system for a proposed development in Brampton. This project required us to first learn to model water distribution networks using EPANet, which is a software used to predict velocities and pressures in pipes. Additionally, we had to plan out the pipe diameters and verify they aligned with guidelines set out in our Design Guidelines (created for the course). These were informed by the Ministry of Environment and other relevant sources. During this project, we also had client consultations, both with our TA and the client, who provided important priorities like cost reduction. When designing the sewer system, we used a spreadsheet (available in the PDF of the final submission). This process was highly iterative as sewer pipes are generally gravity-driven, which implicates various limitations, like ensuring the flow is "subcritical" (i.e., having a high enough depth for its velocity). At the same time, we had to make sure all pipes could adequately connect from the inlet to the outlet, all while experiencing sufficient drops at each junction, to make up for losses in energy due to turns, etc. The final report (available below) is evidence of what I learned about gravity pipe networks and sewage generation demand estimations.

  </a></div>

  <div class="row2">
    <p>Ultimately, the proposed design met all the requirements, and provided a valuable learning experience by highlighting the importance of team communication and how to merge working styles. For example, some of our team preferred working in-person, at the same time, while other students preferred asynchronous work. This led to disagreements in meeting times and stilted work flows. We often experienced delays due to team members working on different aspects of the project at different times. We learned that we should try to compromise and meet semi-regularly to ensure the project is on track. Moreover, we used a shared document to indicate what tasks we accomplished and when, to allow other team members to be aware of the progress being made by the team.
