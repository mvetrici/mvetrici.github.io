      Improving the implementation of bicycles in the <a href="https://tmg.utoronto.ca/doc/1.4/gtamodel/index.html" target="_blank">GTAModel</a> (written proposal, 2024)
    </h3>
    <p>
      This proposal describes various steps in the development of the “bike mode” in the GTAModel. The  GTAModel is a regional transportation model used by the City of Toronto and Metrolinx and models various transportation modes like cars, trains, and walking, and is used to test outcomes of policy implementations like the OneFare program.

        I used Toronto’s OpenData portal and aggregated the data from Toronto's BikeShare stations and user trips. This was all done through Python (using the Pandas library) and required me to learn memory management as these datasets had more than 100,000 data points. I was able to use the data to understand trends in peak hour usage (top), and trips origins and destinations (bottom).

      Next, I needed to understand the specific routes bicyclists take in Toronto. To do so, I spatially aggregated the GTAModel's existing bicycle network and traffic analysis zones, a 2024 network created by another research group, and additional OpenData pedestrian and bike networks, to identify gaps in the model's bike network using ArcGIS (see image at top of page). During this process, I also documented the model's existing bike routes (for the research group), as well as propose new "links" (i.e., bike routes) within the model to represent the existing bike lanes throughout the city that were not captured within the model.

      <p>
        To improve the prediction of bike trips, I created an algorithm using the API of third-party software (see image) used by the GTAModel to predict route choices. This algorithm required an in-depth understanding of the model in order to identify edge cases and boundary conditions relevant in classifying bike routes on different road and safety conditions. I read the model's and Emme's documentation, learned to use Emme, and reviewed the literature on conceptualizing bike networks.

    I used VSCode and GitHub for feedback and collaboration with my supervisor. This project developed my understanding of clean code & clean architecture principles, functional programming, and effective use of memory for managing large datasets. I also used GeoPandas and gained a better understanding of ArcGIS. Most importantly, I learned to work mostly independently and within an ambiguous framework: I originally had a list of requests from my supervisor that I had to figure out and turn into manageable, actionable tasks.

  <p>In my third-year steel design course, I worked with a group to design a steel hangar and office building. Although the course project usually involves SAP2000, which does a majority of the necessary calculations automatically, we were challenged to create the spreadsheets and make decisions regarding engineering assumptions using the Handbook of Steel Construction (HSC). 
    To approach the project, we divided the tasks: some group members created the preliminary spreadsheet to organize the calculations, and I, along with some other members, worked on the structural analysis calculations. For simplicity, these were done by hand (see images) and then implemented within the spreadsheet.

      This project was largely iterative. For example, when designing the steel members used for the columns, we had to account for the loads of the beams the columns were carrying, along with the "self-weight" of the columns. In essence, we could not design the columns until we knew the total loading they had to bear, which depended on the particular column design we chose. Thus, along the course of the project, we slowly developed an intuition for designing the various structural member, developing strategies to estimate the total load a member might have to bear, then iteratively determining exactly which design is the most efficient.

        Because of this, the group collaborated to develop the spreadsheet to optimize our design process. For example, I created a section of our spreadsheet that would automatically calculate the load resistance of a column without needing to manually which column design was used. Previously, we were using a version of the spreadsheet that required the user to input a particular column design before the resistance was calculated. After my update, we could test every single one of our current column designs at once without manually testing them one-by-one. 
  Similarly, I applied my understanding of the nuanced and highly complex structural analysis of "beam-column" members, a particularly complicated type of structural member, and created a spreadsheet that would calculate their loading resistance. Once again, I focused on automating this process to minimize user-related input errors.
  This project also required attention to detail and a close reading and detailed understanding of the HSC. All decisions made over the course of the project needed to be well-justified by the Steel Code, so we all developed a nuanced understanding of the pertinent clauses governing the design of the various structural members. We also ensured these clauses were reflected in the AutoCAD drawings we did.

        Along with integrating the detailed structural analysis calculations into the spreadsheet, our team also developed an understanding of optimizing Excel for the purpose of automation and error-minimization. For example, we learned to link spreadsheets together to improve organization. We also implemented certain principles of software architecture like the use of design patterns (i.e., replicating the same spreadsheet structure across multiple different spreadsheets) to minimize user errors and improve ease of functionality. Similarly, in line with software architecture principles, we tried to minimize "dependencies" across the spreadsheets—I took care to investigate which spreadsheet cells should have fixed values, and which can be changed, and enforced a strict hierarchy throughout all spreadsheets so the base layer of data could not be altered by a user when doing a design check. This proved very helpful in improving our workflow and efficiency. Before, we had to manually reset certain parameters when doing a particular design check, but I used conditional code to encapsulate those steps within each spreadsheet. I also implemented visual cues to also improve user interaction with the spreadsheet.

  How Frequent is Frequent Enough? Exploring the Relationship between the Approach to Identify Ride- sourcing Users and the Specification of Adoption Models

  After a UofT PhD grad came to speak in one of my first-year lectures about his financial analysis work with Uber, I became interested in the area of transportation modelling. I contacted the supervising professor and learned a current PhD student was working on a project an undergrad could lead. This led me to collaborate with two PhD students in UofT's Travel Demand Group to write a paper investigating models that predict ride-sourcing (e.g., Uber) demand. Although the project involved large datasets from surveys conducted in Toronto and Vancouver, the research question was relatively simple, asking how the way a Uber "user" is defined in a model can affect the model's result; in other words, what number of weekly or monthly trips should be used in household surveys to categorize respondents as ride-sourcing "users" or "non-users." 
</p>
</div>

<div class="row2">
    <p>
      I conducted background research into current ride-sourcing models and reviewed existing literature on approaches to models. Through this research, I was able to compile a general framework to apply to the datasets provided by the Cities of Toronto and Vancouver. The general result of the model is summarized as a diagram.
      To align with the current literature and industry modelling practices, we created and studied logistic regression models. However, since I had not previously modeled, I began by conducting research to understand the underlying assumptions, limitations, and theory of logistic regression models. I read textbooks, conducting additional research, and read code and documentation to understand the data analysis packages in R. Then, I made multiple logistic regression models using R. Each model was created using a different definition of a "ride-sourcing user" in order to better understand the impacts of customer behaviour and loyalty over the short- and long-term.

<div class="row2">
<p>
  Once the models were finished, I wrote the literature review, results and discussion sections of the final paper. I also evaluated the models based on research-backed metrics like ROC and R2 that estimate model accuracy. All methods suggested a relatively good fit. I learned to effectively take feedback from my supervisor and to appropriately draw conclusions from the models, i.e., creating nuanced interpretations that consider limitations. 
  The paper was accepted for presentation at the Transportation Research Board 2024 Conference in Washington DC (see picture above). At this conference, I got the chance to present my research to researchers and policymakers from across Canada and the US. I also attended talks about the implementation of driverless cars in San Francisco, traffic management, and best practices for planning infrastructure to accommodate micro-mobility. I learned about the political, behavioral, and practical barriers to transportation ideas, the ways people are tackling them, and how my work could fit into that.
