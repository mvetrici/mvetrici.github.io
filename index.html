      I am a third-year civil engineering student with a strong interest in data analysis and a background in research. I'm interested in learning how data science and computer science can be used to develop more sustainable, equitable and safe municipal systems. This aligns with my values of sustainability and equity, especially connected to climate change. I have experience in transportation modelling and project management.
      <br>
      I am passionate about working on projects that align with my values. I am currently VP Marketing for Women in Science and Engineering, a club founded at UofT in 1999 with the goal of supporting the careers of female students and those comfortable in women-centered spaces. Through my role, I have acquired skills in project management and logistics planning, while getting the opportunity to meet students with diverse experiences, beliefs, and values. The picture below is from our 2025 National Conference where we hosted workshops and panels, with the goal of ultimately empowering attendees to pursue STEM careers.

      The first piece in this portfolio is my proposal for the GTAModelV5, a model of Toronto's transportation system, which allowed me to develop skills in version control, GIS, and data analysis. These skills will provide a foundation for future work in modeling intended to inform policy governing transportation. Eventually, I hope I can use these skills for water resources management. The second piece is a research paper and poster accepted for presentation at the Transportation Research Board. I co-wrote this research paper with PhD students at the University of Toronto, developed and tested logistic regression models, and interpreted their results. 
      <br>
      The third piece is my steel design project: a team project where we applied the 2024 Handbook of Steel Construction and developed spreadsheets to produce a safe steel hangar. The last piece is a sewer system developed for a proposed development, which required a spatial understanding of the development's layout, and applications of hydraulic theory to ensure the system would adequately meet requirements.  
      <br>
      Taken together, these experiences provide a foundation from which I can work on creating informed, data-backed policy within the City of Toronto, while using my own and others' experiences to provide a nuanced interpretation of this data. Policy, and especially data-driven policy, should always serve to improve the lives of each person, not select over-represented or historically-prioritized groups. I hope I can use these skills to work in water resources planning, which depends signficantly on even distribution of benefits. Data-based tools like spreadsheets, as well as predictive models, can be used to inform and more importantly, optimize these decisions, using multi-variate models to keep track of multiple priorities at once.
